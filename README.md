# SpeechRecognition

A small application to launch various website with voice lines.

To start using it run the command : 

###    **pip install -r requirements.txt**

extern libs (pyaudio)

execute the command related to your version of Python (from 3.7 to 3.10)

**pip install ./pyaudio/py3.7/PyAudio-0.2.11-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl**
**pip install ./pyaudio/py3.8/PyAudio-0.2.11-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl**
**pip install ./pyaudio/py3.9/PyAudio-0.2.11-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl**
**pip install ./pyaudio/py3.10/PyAudio-0.2.11-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl**

the program is going to try to download pyaudio for Python 3.9 and 3.10 (one of them is not going to work depending on your version of python)

For now there is only a few website registered.
